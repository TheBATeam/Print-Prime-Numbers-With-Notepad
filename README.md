# Print-Prime-Numbers-With-Notepad
This **Batch program** contains algorithms for calculating Prime Numbers. So, I’ve made two batch files for calculations – but, the algorithm by which they are calculating **prime numbers** is slightly different. Due to this reason, one is calculating them **faster than other**.

# HOW TO PRINT PRIME NUMBERS IN CMD? | BATCH

Two different Algorithms – Same OUTPUT!

## CALCULATE PRIME NUMBERS – SLOWER ALGORITHM:
**Concept:**
This Batch file is simply working blindly on the same fact that a prime number has only **two divisors**, repeating the second nested **FOR LOOP** until the number is achieved itself. So, it makes the loop **slower** as the number (which we have to check is prime or not) gets bigger and bigger. That’s why I called this the **slower algorithm**.

## CHECK PRIME NUMBERS – FASTER ALGORITHM:
**Concept:**
This **Batch file** is based on the fact that if a number is not divisible by any of the **basic numbers (i.e. 1 to 13)**. Then it can be considered as **prime numbers**.

Because all other numbers can be factorized by these basic numbers, I’m not so sure about the accuracy in all cases of this algorithm , but it worked fine when tested it 12 to 15 times.


**Update: I’ve Again Checked the Faster Algorithm – And, Luckily Found Some Flaws. Using the slower algorithm gives the correct answer with all integers.**

Look at the Difference in the OUTPUT of PRIME NUMBERS UPTO 1000 – with both the Algorithms.
